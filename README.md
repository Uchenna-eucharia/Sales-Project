# Sales-Project
Sales dashboard with Excel

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of two companies (Computech and Microworld) for a given period of time (Jan 2023 - June 2023). By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, and sales data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data Source

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "sales_data.xlsx", containing detailed information about sales made by each company's manager on different categories

### Tool

- Excel
  
### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to identify key information, such as:

- Sales by month
- Sales by manager
- Sales by store
- Sales by categories

### Results/Findings

The result analysis was summarised as follows:
1. Computech made sales 10 million while MicroWorld made sales of 4 million
2. Spencer Lee (Manager) made the most sales.
3. Product Category:
   - PC is the best category for Computech while TV is the least.
   - Memory card is the best category for Microworld while games are the least.
4. Microworld made the most sales in April.

### Recommendation

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
 - Information should be sourced from customers on how they feel about our services and products.
 - Proper training should be given to employees on caring for their customers and turning them into returning customers over time.
 - Proper checks should be made on managers to ensure they carry out their duties properly.
 - The location where Microworld is located should be checked for accessibility.
 - Spencer Lee, Jason Hervey, and Chris Fletcher made the most sales, therefore, managers from all branches should work closely with them to get ideas and tips.
 - Reward should be given to managers, employees, and customers who stand out to help boost their performance in the future.
 - The highest sales made by Computech was in April, whatever strategy employed should be implemented always to boost sales in all branches.
 - More supplies should be made on Memory cards and PC to Microworld and Computech respectively while fewer supplies should be made on TV and games to Computech and Microworld respectively.
